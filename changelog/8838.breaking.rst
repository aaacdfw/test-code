As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 6.X series and are now
removed:

* ``pytest._fillfuncargs`` function.

* ``pytest_warning_captured`` hook - use ``pytest_warning_recorded`` instead.

* ``-k -foobar`` syntax - use ``-k 'not foobar'`` instead.

* ``-k foobar:`` syntax.

* ``pytest.collect`` module - import from ``pytest`` directly.
